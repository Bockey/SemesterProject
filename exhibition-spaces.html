            <h2>Biology and medicine</h2>
            <p class="first-par">From micro-organisms to the human body, 
                major breakthroughs in biology are offering 
                us unique insights into the great wonders 
                of the tiny world. 
            </p>                        
            <p class="first-par">    
                For many people their life expectancy is 
                much longer and their quality of life much
                improved, thanks to the growth of our 
                understanding of medicine. Over a series 
                of exhibits we explore the history of 
                medicine and take a look at some major
                breakthroughs including the discovery of 
                penicillin and the first heart transplant.
            </p>
            <p class="first-par">    
                Many of our great medicinal discoveries 
                have come not only from the lab, but also 
                from observing animals in the wild. Often 
                our fellow creatures have beat us to it.
            </p>

            <h2>Evolution</h2>
            <p class="first-par">For centuries, philosophers and scientists 
                have wrestled with the question of our 
                origins. Where do we come from and how 
                did we get here? Since Darwin proposed 
                his theory of evolution we have had a 
                framework for exploring and understanding 
                our place in this world.
            </p>

                Discover the origins of life on this planet 
                and how the species we know today have 
                evolved our time. You can also take some 
                time to meet a few of the creatures who 
                didn’t survive, including our Woolly 
                Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of 
                dinosaurs too.

            <h2>Ecology</h2>
            <p class="first-par">As we learn more and more of the impact 
                humans are having on the planet, the more 
                important it becomes that scientists explore 
                how to create a sustainable future not just
                    for humans but for the whole planet.
            </p>
            <p class="first-par">
                In our ecology section of the museum, we 
                unpack the dangers we currently face 
                including global warming, extinction of 
                species, and pollution. But we also focus 
                on the positive ways we can all contribute 
                to a brighter future.

            <h2>Cosmology</h2>
            <p class="first-par">Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our 
                fantastic exhibition, ‘The Sky Above Us’, 
                explores the night sky and what we can 
                see and know about the universe around 
                us. We’ll locate the various constellations 
                and galaxies that can be seen and learn a 
                bit about the early navigators who used 
                the stars to travel by.
            </p>

                Follow the journey of our solar exploration: 
                from early Arab traders, to Galileo’s 
                telescope, to the latest exploration of the
                planets in our solar system

            <h2>Robotics and AI</h2>
            <p class="first-par">The information revolution is here and 
                robotics and artificial intelligence are the 
                science of the future. From useful home 
                applications of AI to industrial uses of 
                robotics, the future is here. You can even 
                say hello and shake the hand of Rob the 
                Robot.
