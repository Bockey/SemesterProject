                    volunteer their time

                    museum, access to 
                    staff-only lectures, and 
                    a monthly lunch where 
                    all staff and volunteers 
                    come together to 
                    discuss ideas for future 
                    exhibits and strategies 
                    for the museum.

                    in a number of different 
                    spheres.
