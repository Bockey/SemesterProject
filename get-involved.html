            <h2>Support</h2>
            <p class="first-par">There are various ways you can support the 
                museum. Donations are very welcome and 
                are an important way we keep this museum 
                open and accessible to the whole community.
            </p>     
            <p class="first-par">You can also support us by donating items of 
                interest to the museum’s collections. If you 
                have some item or collection that you think 
                others would enjoy, please let us know by 
                contacting our Collections Department and 
                they will be able to assist you.

            <h2>Internships</h2>
            <p class="first-par">Are you interested in 
                working in a museum? 
                Do you enjoy the fun 
                and excitement of 
                sharing the wonders 
                of nature with people? 
                Well you could be just 
                the right person to 
                enjoy an internship at
                the museum.
                You’ll be learning from
                a number of different 
                academics and people 
                who are passionate 
                about science and 
                sharing it with the 
                wider community.

            <h2>Volunteer</h2>
            <p class="first-par">A number of people 
                volunteer their time 
                and effort to keep the 
                displays in good order 
                and ready for visitors 
                to come and enjoy. 
                Volunteering has its 
                perks including getting 
                to see behind the 
                scenes of a working 
                museum, access to 
                staff-only lectures, and 
                a monthly lunch where 
                all staff and volunteers 
                come together to 
                discuss ideas for future 
                exhibits and strategies 
                for the museum.
                You can help volunteer
                in a number of different 
                spheres.
